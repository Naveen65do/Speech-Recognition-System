Project Description:

Speech Recognition System is a web-based application that enables users to convert spoken audio into accurate text using advanced AI models. Built using Flask and powered by OpenAI's Whisper via the stt_whisper_transformers library, the system offers a simple interface for uploading audio files and receiving transcriptions in seconds.

This system is ideal for anyone who needs quick and reliable speech-to-text conversion — such as content creators, journalists, students, or professionals. It supports various audio formats and ensures a smooth user experience from file upload to transcription output.
